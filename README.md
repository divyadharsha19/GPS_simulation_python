# GPS Toll-Based System Simulation using Python

## Overview

The Python code simulates a scenario involving vehicles moving between random start and end points in a simulated city environment (modeled Coimbatore, India). The simulation incorporates GPS-based tracking of vehicle movements, dynamic toll calculation based on predefined toll areas, and interactive visualization of vehicle paths and toll zones using Folium and MatplotlibÂ libraries.

## Features

- **Vehicle Movement Simulation**: Simulate vehicles moving along predefined GPS coordinates.
  
- **Toll Zone Definition**: Define toll zones or points with specific GPS coordinates.
  
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance traveled by each vehicle within toll zones.
  
- **Toll Calculation**: Compute toll charges based on distance traveled or zones passed.
  
- **Payment Simulation**: Simulate the deduction of toll charges from user accounts.
## Ensuring GPS-Like Functionality
- **Geographic Coordinates**:
  Uses latitude and longitude to define start points, end points, and toll areas, mimicking GPS coordinates.
- **Simulated Movement**:
  Updates car positions incrementally to simulate driving, akin to GPS tracking.
- **Distance Calculation**:
  Uses geopy.distance to measure distances between coordinates, similar to how GPS calculates distance traveled.

## Dependencies

This project depends on several Python libraries:

- **SimPy**: For discrete-event simulation.
- **GeoPandas**: For manipulating geographic data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Geopy**: For calculating distances between coordinates.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs.
- **Folium**: For creating interactive maps.
- **UUID**: For generating unique identifiers.
- **Random**: For generating random numbers.

## Installation

To run the GPS toll-based system simulation project, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
```

### Install dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install simpy geopandas pandas geopy matplotlib folium uuid random
```

### Setup environment:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., virtualenv or conda) to manage dependencies and isolate the project environment.

```bash
# Example using virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `source venv\Scripts\activate`
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the GPS toll-based system simulation:

1. **Start the simulation**:

   Execute the main script to start the simulation:
   
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

2. **View output**:

   The script generates visualizations (map and graphs) to illustrate vehicle movements, toll zones, and other relevant data.

3. **Interact with the map**:

   Open `THE_BEST_TECHIES_MAP.html` in a web browser to view the Folium map showing Coimbatore, India, with marked toll zones.

4. **Explore the graph**:

   Check `car_movements_graph.png` for the plot illustrating simulated car movements over time.

5. **Understand the console output**:

   Console logs provide real-time updates on car status, toll crossings, and payment details.
