# GPS Toll-Based System Simulation using Python

## Overview

This project implements a simulation of a GPS-based toll system using Python. It models vehicle movements, defines toll zones, calculates distances traveled within toll zones, computes toll charges based on the distance traveled or zones passed, and simulates the payment process. The simulation provides visualizations and data outputs illustrating vehicle interactions with toll zones and the overall functionality of such a system.

## Features

- **Vehicle Movement Simulation**: Simulate vehicles moving along predefined GPS coordinates.
  
- **Toll Zone Definition**: Define toll zones or points with specific GPS coordinates.
  
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance traveled by each vehicle within toll zones.
  
- **Toll Calculation**: Compute toll charges based on distance traveled or zones passed.
  
- **Payment Simulation**: Simulate the deduction of toll charges from user accounts.

## Dependencies

This project depends on several Python libraries:

- **SimPy**: For discrete-event simulation.
- **GeoPandas**: For manipulating geographic data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Geopy**: For calculating distances between coordinates.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs.
- **Folium**: For creating interactive maps.
- **UUID**: For generating unique identifiers.
- **Random**: For generating random numbers.

## Installation

To run the GPS toll-based system simulation project, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
```

### Install dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install simpy geopandas pandas geopy matplotlib folium uuid random
```

### Setup environment:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., virtualenv or conda) to manage dependencies and isolate the project environment.

```bash
# Example using virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `source venv\Scripts\activate`
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the GPS toll-based system simulation:

1. **Start the simulation**:

   Execute the main script to start the simulation:
   
   ```bash
   python traffic_simulation.py
   ```

2. **View output**:

   The script generates visualizations (map and graphs) to illustrate vehicle movements, toll zones, and other relevant data.

3. **Interact with the map**:

   Open `THE_BEST_TECHIES_MAP.html` in a web browser to view the Folium map showing Coimbatore, India, with marked toll zones.

4. **Explore the graph**:

   Check `car_movements_graph.png` for the plot illustrating simulated car movements over time.

5. **Understand the console output**:

   Console logs provide real-time updates on car status, toll crossings, and payment details.
