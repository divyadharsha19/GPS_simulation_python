### Functions

1. **create_toll_areas()**
   - **Purpose**: Creates toll areas with dynamic rates.
   - **Details**: 
     - Uses `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` to define two toll areas with specific GPS coordinates and their corresponding rates.
     - Logs the creation of toll areas.

2. **create_folium_map(toll_areas)**
   - **Purpose**: Creates a Folium map with toll zones.
   - **Details**:
     - Initializes a map centered on Coimbatore.
     - Adds markers for each toll area on the map.
     - Returns the Folium map object.

3. **Car**
   - **Purpose**: Represents a car in the simulation.
   - **Methods**:
     - `__init__`: Initializes a car with starting and ending points, speed, fuel level, and other attributes.
     - `drive`: Simulates the car's movement from start to end point, consuming fuel and logging the status.
     - `refuel`: Refuels the car to a specified amount.
     - `check_status`: Logs the car's current status and fuel level.
     - `_update_location`: Updates the car's location based on its speed.
     - `_consume_fuel`: Consumes fuel based on the car's speed and updates its status if fuel runs out.

4. **detect_toll_crossing(car, toll_areas)**
   - **Purpose**: Detects if a car crosses any toll areas.
   - **Details**:
     - Checks if the car's path intersects with any toll areas.
     - Logs and records the toll areas crossed by the car.

5. **compute_toll_fees(car, toll_areas, current_time)**
   - **Purpose**: Computes toll fees for a car based on its path and the toll areas it crosses.
   - **Details**:
     - Defines peak hours for dynamic toll rates.
     - Calculates toll fees based on the distance traveled within toll areas and the applicable rate.
     - Logs the toll fees for each car.

6. **process_payment(account, toll_fee)**
   - **Purpose**: Processes payment for toll fees from a specified account.
   - **Details**:
     - Deducts the toll fee from the account balance if sufficient funds are available.
     - Logs the transaction and warns if the balance is insufficient.

7. **create_car_movements_graph(cars)**
   - **Purpose**: Creates a graph of car movements over time.
   - **Details**:
     - Simulates car movement data over time steps.
     - Plots the data using Matplotlib.
     - Displays the plot.

8. **main()**
   - **Purpose**: The main function to run the simulation.
   - **Details**:
     - Sets up the simulation environment.
     - Creates cars with random start and end points.
     - Runs the simulation for a specified time.
     - Detects toll crossings and computes toll fees for each car.
     - Processes payments for toll fees.
     - Creates and saves a Folium map with toll zones.
     - Creates and displays a graph of car movements.

### Example Usage

1. **Set up logging**: Configures logging for debugging and information purposes.
2. **Simulate car movements**: Creates cars and simulates their movement, fuel consumption, and interactions with toll areas.
3. **Compute toll fees**: Calculates toll fees based on car movements and toll areas.
4. **Process payments**: Processes payments for toll fees from a predefined account.
5. **Visualize results**: Creates an interactive map and a graph to visualize the simulation results.
